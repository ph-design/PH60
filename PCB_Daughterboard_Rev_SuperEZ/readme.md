## Introduction

The Unified Daughterboard Project standardizes USB daughterboards for custom mechanical keyboards. It provides a tested PCB design, ensuring easier maintenance and repair.

## S Series

The S1 variant features a new form factor developed from real-world production usage and designer input.

### Features:

- **Form Factor**: "Wide and narrow" 40mm wide x 9mm deep x 1.6mm thick, avoiding common obstacles in custom keyboards. Mountable both right-side-up and upside-down.
- **Mounting Points**: 2 x M3 mounting points, reducing thread defect issues and assembly effort.
- **Sourcing**: Easy and inexpensive to source via JLCPCB or similar.
- **Design Enhancements**: Large DB corner radii allow keyboard cases to be milled at a large inner radius.
- **Protection and Shielding**: ESD protection, overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection, shielding noise decoupling, and single-path grounding to chassis functionality.
- **Connector**: New Molex Pico-EZmate Connector, replacing the JST-SH on previous versions, with 1:1 connector pinout to retain compatibility with existing PCBs.

### My Modifications

This project is based on the Unified Daughterboard S Series (UDB-S). Key modifications include:

- **Redesigned PCB**: The PCB dimensions have been altered to better fit custom keyboards.
- **Updated Slots**: The slots between the PCB and keyboard connections have been replaced to make USB-C connector more flexible.
